## File Structure
- Test files should be named `*.test.ts` and placed in a `tests` directory on the same level as the file being tested
	- Example: For `src/utils/StatsHandler.ts`, the test should be at `src/utils/tests/StatsHandler.test.ts`
- Do not create a separate `__tests__` directory

## Test Organization
- Only use `describe` blocks when testing multiple distinct features/components in a single test file
- For single utility tests, use `it` blocks directly without wrapping them in `describe`
- When referencing code values in test names (variables, properties, etc.), wrap them in backticks
  - ✅ `it('should save play stats without `requestedById`')`
  - ❌ `it('should save play stats without requestedById')`

## Mocking
- **Never** mock simple utility functions (like `isObject`, `pluralize`, etc.) – let them run naturally in tests
- Only mock external dependencies and complex integrations that require specific context (like Discord.js, discord-player)
- When mocking is necessary, try to provide only the minimal implementations
- When using multiple `vi.mocked()` calls, define them as constants at the top of the test file
	- Example: `const mockedFunction = vi.mocked(originalFunction)`
- When mocking external dependencies that require types, use type-only imports:
  ```typescript
  import type { ExternalType } from 'package';
  ```
- **Never** use dynamic imports or `require` calls as a hacky way to avoid certain Vitest problems – mock primarily via `vi.mock(...)`
- Consult the `src/setupTests.ts` file and use it to define global mocks

## Test Data
- Reusable test data (URLs, IDs, example inputs) should be defined as constants at the top of the test file, after imports but before mocks
	- Example: `const EXAMPLE_PLAYLIST_URL = 'https://open.spotify.com/playlist/...'`
- Constants should be placed before any mocks or other code

## Other
- Don't ask me to review the test without running it first and fixing any issues, including TypeScript errors!
