# General guidelines
- Use the appropriate package manage (`pnpm`)
- Do not write code comments about *what* something is/does, unless it would be very difficult to understand and cannot be simplified
- Write code comments on *why* something was done, but only if it appears strange/unnecessary/overly complicated
- Do not ask me to review files with multiple TypeScript issues, they should be fixed beforehand
